      "ITEM 7.           MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF       OPERATIONS.           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:   2016   COMPARED TO   2015    OVERVIEW    Airgas, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Airgas  or the  Company ) had net sales for the year ended   March 31, 2016   ( fiscal   2016    or  current year ) of   $5.3 billion  , essentially flat compared to the year ended     March 31, 2015   ( fiscal   2015    or  prior year )  . Organic sales decreased   1%   compared to the prior year, with gas and rent up   2%   and hardgoods down   7%  . Current and prior year acquisitions contributed sales growth of   1%   in the current year. The Company s organic sales continue to reflect the challenging industrial economy and in particular the pressure on sales to customers engaged in the energy and chemical and the manufacturing and metal fabrication sectors. The sluggish U.S. industrial economy, slowing global economy and strong dollar continue to challenge the Company s customers across these and other sectors. Continued strength in certain sectors, such as non-residential construction, helped to mitigate these sales declines.     The consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) in the current year was   56.7%  , an increase of   110   basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting a sales mix shift toward higher margin gas and rent, and higher margins in the Company s All Other Operations business segment.     The Company s operating income margin in the current year was   10.9%  , a decrease of   120   basis points from the prior year. The current year's operating income margin was burdened by   70   basis points of costs related to the   Agreement and Plan of Merger   with Air Liquide (see below for additional information) and other special charges. Excluding the merger-related costs and other special charges, the operating income margin was down   50   basis points, primarily reflecting challenging economic conditions and the impact of rising operating costs (including depreciation and amortization expenses) in the current negative organic sales growth environment, in the Company s Distribution business segment.    Net earnings per diluted share was   $4.54   in the current year versus   $4.85   in the prior year. Net earnings per diluted share in the current year included a $0.24 per diluted share charge related to merger costs associated with the Air Liquide Merger and a non-tax-deductible $0.09 per diluted share charge related to a Plea Agreement by Airgas Doral, Inc. ( Airgas Doral ) with the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Florida.     Air Liquide Merger Agreement    On November 17, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of the Company by L Air Liquide, S.A. ( Air Liquide ) in a merger pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 17, 2015, by and among the Company, Air Liquide and AL Acquisition Corporation ( Merger Sub ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Air Liquide (the  Merger Agreement ).   The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the  Merger ) with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Air Liquide.     See Note 2,  Merger Agreement,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,    for more information on the Merger Agreement.       In connection with the Merger, the Company has incurred   $29 million   of merger-related costs during the year ended   March 31, 2016  , primarily consisting of legal, advisory and other professional fees in connection with the Merger. These costs are included in the  Merger costs and other special charges  line item of the Company s consolidated statement of earnings.    Stock Repurchase Program    On May 28, 2015, the Company announced plans to repurchase up to $500 million of Airgas, Inc. common stock under a stock repurchase program approved by the Company s Board of Directors. Airgas may repurchase shares from time to time for cash in open market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The Company will determine the timing and the amount of any repurchases based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price, and other factors. The stock repurchase program has no pre-established closing date; however, stock repurchases are currently suspended in accordance with   the Merger Agreement. See Note 2,  Merger Agreement,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements   under Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,    for more information on the Merger Agreement.     From the announcement date of the program through September 30, 2015, the Company repurchased   3.8 million   shares on the open market at an average price of   $99.54  . The Company did not repurchase any shares during the six-month period ended   March 31, 2016  . At   March 31, 2016  ,   $125 million   was available for additional share repurchases under the program.        20       STATEMENT OF EARNINGS COMMENTARY - FISCAL YEAR ENDED   MARCH 31, 2016   COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED   MARCH 31, 2015    Net Sales    Net sales of   $5.3 billion   for the current year were essentially flat compared to the prior year, with a decrease in organic sales of   1%   offset by sales growth from current and prior year acquisitions of   1%  . Gas and rent organic sales increased   2%   in the current year, and hardgoods organic sales decreased   7%  . Organic sales growth in the current year was driven by price increases of   1%   and volume decreases of   2%  .     Strategic products represent approximately 40% of net sales and are comprised of safety products and bulk, medical and specialty gases (and associated rent), which are sold to end customers through the Distribution business segment, and carbon dioxide ( CO   2    ) and dry ice, the vast majority of which is sold to end customers through the All Other Operations business segment. The Company has identified these products as strategic because it believes they have good long-term growth profiles relative to the Company s core industrial gas and welding products due to favorable end customer markets, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross-selling opportunities or a combination thereof. During the current year, sales of strategic products in aggregate increased   1%   on an organic basis as compared to the prior year.     The Company s strategic accounts program, which represents approximately 25% of net sales, is designed to deliver superior product and service offerings to larger, multi-location customers, and presents the Company with strong cross-selling and greater penetration opportunities. Sales to strategic accounts in the current year increased   1%   compared to the prior year.     In the following table, the intercompany eliminations represent sales from the All Other Operations business segment to the Distribution business segment.      The Distribution business segment s principal products and services include industrial, medical and specialty gases, and process chemicals; cylinder and equipment rental; and hardgoods. Industrial, medical and specialty gases are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers. Rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, dewars (cryogenic liquid cylinders), bulk and micro-bulk tanks, tube trailers and certain welding equipment. Hardgoods generally consist of welding consumables and equipment, safety products, construction supplies, and maintenance, repair and operating supplies.    Distribution business segment sales decreased   1%   compared to the prior year, with a decrease in organic sales of   2%  . Incremental sales from current and prior year acquisitions contributed sales growth of   1%   in the current year. Higher pricing of   1%   and volume decreases of   3%   resulted in the   2%   decrease in organic sales in the Distribution business segment. Gas and rent organic sales in the Distribution business segment increased   1%  , with pricing up   1%   and volumes flat. Hardgoods organic sales within the Distribution business segment decreased   7%  , with pricing flat and volumes down   7%  .     Within the Distribution business segment, organic sales of gas related strategic products and associated rent increased   4%   over the prior year, comprised of the following: bulk gas and rent up   5%  , on higher pricing and volumes; specialty gas, rent, and related equipment up   6%  , on moderate growth in core specialty gas volumes; and medical gas and rent up   2%  , as increases to physician and dental practices, as well as hospitals and surgery centers, were partially offset by weakness in wholesale sales to homecare distributors. In addition, organic sales in the Company s Red-D-Arc business decreased   1%   over the prior year, driven by weakness in generator rentals to oilfield services customers in the second half of the year.    Within the Distribution business segment s hardgoods sales, sales of safety products decreased by   6%   compared to the prior year on broad based moderation in core industrial activity. Sales of the Company s Radnor        private-label product line, which includes certain safety products, consumables, and other hardgoods, decreased   4%   in the current year, compared to the   7%   decrease in total hardgoods organic sales in the Distribution business segment.    The All Other Operations business segment consists of   six   business units. The primary products manufactured and/or distributed are CO   2   ,   dry ice, nitrous oxide, ammonia and refrigerant gases, along with a nitrogen services business  .    The All Other Operations business segment sales increased   13%   compared to the prior year, with an increase in organic sales of   7%  . Incremental sales from current and prior year acquisitions contributed sales growth of   6%   in the current year. The strong organic growth in the All Other Operations business segment was driven by sales increases primarily in the Company s         21            refrigerants, as well as dry ice businesses. Organic sales of CO   2    and dry ice, the vast majority of which is sold to end customers through the All Other Operations business segment, increased   7%   over the prior year on higher pricing and volumes.    Gross Profits (Excluding Depreciation)    Gross profits (excluding depreciation) do not reflect deductions related to depreciation expense and distribution costs. The Company reflects distribution costs as an element of the line item  Selling, distribution and administrative expenses  and recognizes depreciation on all of its property, plant and equipment in the line item  Depreciation  in its consolidated statements of earnings. Other companies may report certain or all of these costs as elements of their cost of products sold and, as such, the Company s gross profits (excluding depreciation) discussed below may not be comparable to those of other companies.    Consolidated gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased   2%   in the current year compared to the prior year, reflecting margin expansion on favorable sales mix. The consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) in the current year increased   110   basis points to   56.7%   compared to   55.6%   in the prior year. The increase in consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) primarily reflects the sales mix shift toward higher margin gas and rent and higher margins in the Company s All Other Operations business segment, partially offset by a sales mix shift within gas toward lower margin refrigerants. Gas and rent represented   65.1%   of the Company s sales mix in the current year, up from   63.2%   in the prior year.   The Distribution business segment s gross profits (excluding depreciation) were down modestly compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the decline in the Distribution business segment s sales, partially offset by higher margins. The Distribution business segment s gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) increased   60   basis points to   56.8%   in the current year from   56.2%   in the prior year. The increase in the Distribution business segment s gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) reflects a sales mix shift toward higher margin gas and rent, partially offset by margin pressure within gas and rent on higher helium costs and a sales mix shift toward lower margin bulk gas. Gas and rent represented   60.8%   of the Distribution business segment s sales in the current year, up from   59.1%   in the prior year.    The All Other Operations business segment s gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased   24%   compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the increase in refrigerants and dry ice sales, margin expansion in the Company s ammonia and refrigerants businesses, and the inclusion of the Priority Nitrogen acquisition. The All Other Operations business segment s gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) increased   460   basis points to   52.4%   in the current year from   47.8%   in the prior year. The increase in the All Other Operations business segment s gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was primarily driven by margin expansion in the Company s ammonia and refrigerants businesses plus the addition of the higher-margin Priority Nitrogen business.    Operating Expenses    Selling, Distribution and Administrative ( SD A ) Expenses    SD A expenses consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Company s products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility-related expenses. Additionally, the Company s merger costs and other special charges are not allocated to the Company s business segments. These costs are captured in a separate line item on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are reflected in the  Merger costs and other special charges  line item in the operating income table below.    Consolidated SD A expenses increased   $64 million  , or   3%  , in the current year as compared to the prior year. Contributing to the increase in SD A expenses were approximately   $28 million   of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses, representing approximately   1.4%   of the total increase in SD A. The remaining increase is primarily related to normal inflation, as well as the incremental costs to support strong organic sales growth in the All Other Operations segment. As a percentage of consolidated gross profit, consolidated SD A expenses increased   70   basis points to   67.8%   in the current year, compared to   67.1%   in the prior year.         22            SD A expenses in the Distribution business segment increased   2%   compared to the prior year. Contributing to the increase in SD A expenses in the Distribution business segment were approximately   $17 million   of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses, representing approximately   1%   of the increase in SD A. As a percentage of Distribution business segment gross profit, SD A expenses in the Distribution business segment increased   150   basis points to   68.3%   compared to   66.8%   in the prior year.     SD A expenses in the All Other Operations business segment increased   15%   compared to the prior year. Contributing to the increase in SD A expenses in the All Other Operations business segment were approximately   $11 million   of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses, representing approximately   6%   of the increase in SD A. Incremental costs to support strong organic sales growth in the All Other Operations business segment, also contributed to the increase. As a percentage of All Other Operations business segment gross profit, SD A expenses in the All Other Operations business segment decreased   540   basis points to   64.2%   compared to   69.6%   in the prior year, primarily driven by strong sales and margin growth within the business segment.     Merger Costs and Other Special Charges    During the current year, the Company incurred   $29 million   of merger-related costs, primarily consisting of legal, advisory and other professional fees in connection with the Merger Agreement with Air Liquide. Additionally, during the current year, the Company accrued costs of   $7 million   related to a Plea Agreement by Airgas Doral with the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Florida, concerning past violations in connection with the handling, labeling and transportation of certain hazardous materials shipments from the Company s Miami facilities to consignees located in South America. The Company s merger costs and other special charges are captured in a separate line item on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Earnings and not allocated to the Company s business segments.    Depreciation and Amortization    Depreciation expense increased   $21 million  , or   7%  , to   $319 million   in the current year as compared to the prior year. The increase primarily reflects the additional depreciation expense on capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand (such as cylinders/bulk tanks and rental welders/generators), investments in the Company s eBusiness platform and other system enhancements, and $2 million of additional depreciation expense on capital assets included in acquisitions. Amortization expense of   $34 million   in the current year increased by   $3 million   compared to the prior year, driven by acquisitions.     Operating Income    Consolidated operating income of   $581 million   decreased   $61 million  ,   9%  , in the current year compared to the prior year, with merger costs and other special charges of   $36 million   accounting for over half of the decline. The remaining decrease is primarily attributable to lower operating income in the Company s Distribution business segment, partially offset by higher operating income in the Company s All Other Operations business segment, as noted below. The consolidated operating income margin decreased   120   basis points to   10.9%   from   12.1%   in the prior year, of which   70   basis points of decline is due to merger-related costs and other special charges.   Operating income in the Distribution business segment decreased   10%   compared to the prior year. The Distribution business segment s operating income margin of   11.3%   decreased by   100   basis points compared to the operating income margin of   12.3%   in the prior year. The decline in the Distribution business segment s operating income margin primarily reflects the         23            impact of rising operating costs (including depreciation and amortization expenses) in the current negative organic sales growth environment.    Operating income in the All Other Operations business segment increased   63%   compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the increase in refrigerants and dry ice sales, margin expansion as described below, and the inclusion of the Priority Nitrogen acquisition. The All Other Operations business segment s operating income margin of   13.3%   increased by   400   basis points compared to the operating income margin of   9.3%   in the prior year. The increase in the All Other Operations business segment s operating income margin was primarily driven by margin expansion in the Company s ammonia and refrigerants businesses.     Interest Expense, Net    Interest expense, net, was   $60 million   in the current year, representing a decrease of   $2 million  , or   3%  , compared to the prior year. The overall decrease in interest expense, net resulted   primarily from lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average debt balances, in the current year as compared to the prior year.     Income Tax Expense    The effective income tax rate was   36.3%   of pre-tax earnings in the current year compared to   37.0%   in the prior year.     Net Earnings    Net earnings per diluted share decreased   6%   to   $4.54   in the current year compared to   $4.85   per diluted share in the prior year. Net earnings were   $338 million   in the current year compared to   $368 million   in the prior year. Net earnings in the current year included costs of   $18 million   (net of tax) or a $0.24 per diluted share charge related to merger costs associated with the Merger and   $7 million   (non-tax-deductible) or a $0.09 per diluted share charge related to a Plea Agreement by Airgas Doral with the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Florida. Net earnings in the prior year were not impacted by special items.         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:   2015   COMPARED TO   2014    OVERVIEW    Airgas had net sales for fiscal   2015   of   $5.3 billion   compared to   $5.1 billion   for the year ended   March 31, 2014   ( fiscal   2014   ), an increase of   5%  . Organic sales increased   3%   compared to   fiscal   2014  , with gas and rent up   3%   and hardgoods up   4%  . Acquisitions contributed sales growth of   2%   in fiscal   2015  .   Through the first nine months of fiscal 2015, organic sales growth was 3%, with the third quarter showing the strongest year over year growth rate of 6%. The Company s fiscal 2015 fourth quarter year over year organic growth rate fell to 2% as the energy   chemicals and manufacturing customer segments were negatively impacted by the significant and rapid decline in oil prices and the strong U.S. dollar.     The consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) in fiscal   2015   was   55.6%  , a decrease of   10   basis points from fiscal   2014  .     The Company s operating income margin in fiscal 2015 was   12.1%  , a decrease of   30   basis points from fiscal   2014  , primarily reflecting the sales mix shift toward lower margin hardgoods, the impact of rising operating costs and the Company s continued investments in strategic long-term growth initiatives in a low organic sales growth environment.     Net earnings per diluted share increased to   $4.85   in fiscal   2015   versus   $4.68   in fiscal   2014  . Net earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2014 included $0.04 per diluted share in benefits related to changes in state income tax rates and law, and an $0.08 loss on the early extinguishment of debt.     STATEMENT OF EARNINGS COMMENTARY - FISCAL YEAR ENDED   MARCH 31, 2015   COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED   MARCH 31, 2014    Net Sales    Net sales increased   5%   to   $5.3 billion   for fiscal   2015   compared to fiscal   2014  , driven by organic sales growth of   3%   and sales growth from acquisitions of   2%  . Gas and rent organic sales increased   3%   and hardgoods organic sales increased   4%  . Organic sales growth in fiscal   2015   was driven by price increases of   2%   and volume increases of   1%  .

Sales to strategic accounts in fiscal   2015   grew   5%   compared to fiscal   2014  .     In the following table, the intercompany eliminations represent sales from the All Other Operations business segment to the Distribution business segment.        24            Distribution business segment sales increased   5%   compared to fiscal   2014  , with an increase in organic sales of   3%   and incremental sales of   2%   contributed by acquisitions. Higher pricing contributed   2%   and volume increases contributed   1%   to organic sales growth in the Distribution business segment. Gas and rent organic sales in the Distribution business segment increased   2%  , with pricing up   3%   and volumes down   1%  . Hardgoods organic sales within the Distribution business segment increased   4%  , with pricing up   1%   and volumes up   3%  .     Within the Distribution business segment, organic sales of gas related strategic products and associated rent increased   4%   in fiscal   2015  , comprised of the following: bulk gas and rent up   5%   on higher pricing and volumes; specialty gas, rent, and related equipment up   3%  , primarily driven by increases in core specialty gas prices and volumes; and medical gas and rent up   2%  , as increases to physician and dental practices, as well as hospitals and surgery centers, were partially offset by weakness in wholesale sales to homecare distributors. In addition, organic sales in the Company s Red-D-Arc business increased   14%   in fiscal   2015  , driven by increases in both welder and generator rentals in the non-residential construction and energy customer segments.    Within the Distribution business segment s hardgoods sales, organic sales of equipment were up   8%   year-over-year. Sales of Safety products increased   4%   in fiscal   2015   driven by volume gains. Sales of the Company s Radnor  private-label product line, which includes certain safety products, consumables, and other hardgoods, increased   4%   in fiscal   2015  , consistent with the   4%   increase in total hardgoods organic sales in the Distribution business segment.    The All Other Operations business segment sales increased   3%   in total and on an organic basis compared to fiscal   2014  . Sales increases in the Company s CO   2   , dry ice and ammonia businesses were partially offset by the decline in sales in its refrigerants business during fiscal   2015  . Organic sales of CO   2    and dry ice increased   3%   over fiscal   2014  .     Gross Profits (Excluding Depreciation)       Consolidated gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased   4%   in fiscal   2015   compared to fiscal   2014  , reflecting the overall growth in sales, margin expansion on price increases and surcharges related to power cost spikes in the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter, partially offset by supplier price and internal production cost increases and a sales mix shift toward lower margin hardgoods. The consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) in fiscal   2015   decreased   10   basis points to   55.6%   compared to   55.7%   in fiscal   2014  . The decrease in consolidated gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) reflects margin expansion on price increases offset by a sales mix shift toward lower margin hardgoods. Gas and rent represented   63.2%   of the Company s sales mix in fiscal   2015  , down from   63.6%   in fiscal   2014  .   The Distribution business segment s gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased   5%   compared to fiscal   2014  . The Distribution business segment s gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) remained consistent at   56.2%   in fiscal   2015   and fiscal   2014  . The Distribution business segment s flat gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) reflects margin expansion on price increases and surcharges related to power cost spikes in the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter, offset by a sales mix shift toward lower margin hardgoods. Gas and rent represented   59.1%   of the Distribution business segment s sales in fiscal   2015  , down from   59.6%   in fiscal   2014  .     The All Other Operations business segment s gross profits (excluding depreciation) increased   2%   compared to fiscal   2014  . The All Other Operations business segment s gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) decreased 40 basis points to   47.8%   in fiscal   2015   from   48.2%   in fiscal   2014  . The decrease in the All Other Operations business segment s gross profit margin (excluding depreciation) was primarily driven by a sales mix shift toward lower margin ammonia and slight margin pressure in the Company s CO   2   , refrigerants and ammonia businesses, partially offset by a sales mix shift away from lower margin refrigerants.         25            Operating Expenses     SD A Expenses    SD A expenses consist of labor and overhead associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Company s products, as well as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury, accounting, tax and facility-related expenses. Although corporate operating expenses are generally allocated to each business segment based on sales dollars, the Company reported expenses (excluding depreciation) related to the implementation of its SAP system as part of SD A expenses in the  Other  line item in the SD A expenses and operating income tables below.    Consolidated SD A expenses increased   $90 million  , or   5%  , in fiscal   2015   as compared to fiscal   2014  . Contributing to the increase in SD A expenses were approximately $27 million of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses, representing approximately 1.4% of the total increase in SD A. Normal inflation, as well as expenses associated with the Company s investments in long-term strategic growth initiatives, including its e-Business platform, continued expansion of its telesales business through Airgas Total Access , and regional management structure changes, also contributed to the increase. As a percentage of consolidated gross profit, consolidated SD A expenses increased   20   basis points to   67.1%   in fiscal   2015  , compared to   66.9%   in fiscal   2014  .    SD A expenses in the Distribution business segment increased   5%  , while SD A expenses in the All Other Operations business segment increased   6%  , compared to fiscal   2014  . Contributing to the increase in SD A expenses in the Distribution business segment were approximately $27 million of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses, representing approximately 1.5% of the increase in SD A. Normal inflation, as well as expenses associated with the Company s investments in long-term strategic growth initiatives, including its e-Business platform, continued expansion of its telesales business through Airgas Total Access , and regional management structure changes, also contributed to the increase. As a percentage of Distribution business segment gross profit, SD A expenses in the Distribution business segment increased   30   basis points to   66.8%   compared to   66.5%   in fiscal   2014  . As a percentage of All Other Operations business segment gross profit, SD A expenses in the All Other Operations business segment increased   240   basis points to   69.6%   compared to   67.2%   in fiscal   2014  , primarily driven by margin pressure as noted above.     SD A Expenses   Other    Enterprise Information System    As of March 31, 2013, the Company had successfully converted its Safety telesales and hardgoods infrastructure businesses, as well as all of its regional distribution businesses, to the SAP platform. The Company continued to incur some post-conversion support and training expenses related to the implementation of the new system through the end of fiscal 2014. SAP-related integration costs were $7.4 million in fiscal 2014, and were recorded as SD A expenses and not allocated to the Company s business segments.     Depreciation and Amortization    Depreciation expense increased   $22 million  , or   8%  , to   $298 million   in fiscal   2015   as compared to fiscal   2014  . The increase primarily reflects the additional depreciation expense on capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand (such as cylinders/bulk tanks and rental welders/generators) and $3 million of additional depreciation expense on capital assets included in acquisitions. Amortization expense of   $31 million   in fiscal   2015   increased by   $2 million   compared to fiscal   2014  , driven by acquisitions.     Operating Income     Consolidated operating income of   $641 million   increased   2%   in fiscal   2015   compared to fiscal   2014  , primarily driven by organic sales growth. The consolidated operating income margin increased 30 basis points to   12.1%   compared to   12.4%   in fiscal   2014  , primarily reflecting a sales mix shift toward hardgoods.         26            Operating income in the Distribution business segment increased   2%   in fiscal   2015  . The Distribution business segment s operating income margin decreased 40 basis points to   12.3%   from   12.7%   in fiscal   2014  . The decline in the Distribution business segment s operating income margin primarily reflects the sales mix shift toward lower margin hardgoods and the impact of risi\n"

contributed sales growth of   1   in the current year The Company s organic sales continue to reflect the challenging industrial economy and in particular the pressure on sales to customers engaged in the energy and chemical and the manufacturing and metal fabrication sectors The sluggish US industrial economy slowing global economy and strong dollar continue to challenge the Company s customers across these and other sectors Continued strength in certain sectors such as nonresidential construction helped to mitigate these sales declines     The consolidated gross profit margin excluding depreciation in the current year was   567   an increase of   110   basis points from the prior year primarily reflecting a sales mix shift toward higher margin gas and rent and higher margins in the Company s All Other Operations business segment     The Company s operating income margin in the current year was   109   a decrease of   120   basis points from the prior year The current years operating income margin was burdened by   70   basis points of costs related to the   Agreement and Plan of Merger   with Air Liquide see below for additional information and other special charges Excluding the mergerrelated costs and other special charges the operating income margin was down   50   basis points primarily reflecting challenging economic conditions and the impact of rising operating costs including depreciation and amortization expenses in the current negative organic sales growth environment in the Company s Distribution business segment    Net earnings per diluted share was   454   in the current year versus   485   in the prior year Net earnings per diluted share in the current year included a 024 per diluted share charge related to merger costs associated with the Air Liquide Merger and a nontaxdeductible 009 per diluted share charge related to a Plea Agreement by Airgas Doral Inc  Airgas Doral  with the US Attorney s Office for the Southern District

decreased   7   Organic sales growth in the current year was driven by price increases of   1   and volume decreases of   2       Strategic products represent approximately 40 of net sales and are comprised of safety products and bulk medical and specialty gases and associated rent which are sold to end customers through the Distribution business segment and carbon dioxide  CO   2     and dry ice the vast majority of which is sold to end customers through the All Other Operations business segment The Company has identified these products as strategic because it believes they have good longterm growth profiles relative to the Company s core industrial gas and welding products due to favorable end customer markets application development increasing environmental regulation strong crossselling opportunities or a combination thereof During the current year sales of strategic products in aggregate increased   1   on an organic basis as compared to the prior year     The Company s strategic accounts program which represents approximately 25 of net sales is designed to deliver superior product and service offerings to larger multilocation customers and presents the Company with

up   6   on moderate growth in core specialty gas volumes and medical gas and rent up   2   as increases to physician and dental practices as well as hospitals and surgery centers were partially offset by weakness in wholesale sales to homecare distributors In addition organic sales in the Company s RedDArc business decreased   1   over the prior year driven by weakness in generator rentals to oilfield services customers in the second half of the year    Within the Distribution business segment s hardgoods sales sales of safety products decreased by   6   compared to the prior year on

segment sales increased   13   compared to the prior year with an increase in organic sales of   7   Incremental sales from current and prior year acquisitions contributed sales growth of   6   in the current year The strong organic growth in the All Other Operations business segment was driven by sales increases primarily in the Company s         21            refrigerants as well as dry ice businesses Organic sales of CO   2    and dry ice the vast majority of which is sold to end customers through the All Other Operations business segment increased   7   over the prior year on higher pricing and volumes    Gross Profits Excluding Depreciation    Gross profits excluding depreciation do not reflect deductions related to depreciation expense and distribution costs The Company reflects distribution costs as an element of the line item  Selling distribution and administrative expenses  and recognizes depreciation on all of its property plant and equipment in the line item

from   632   in the prior year   The Distribution business segment s gross profits excluding depreciation were down modestly compared to the prior year primarily driven by the decline in the

current year from   562   in the prior year The increase in the Distribution business segment s gross profit margin excluding depreciation reflects a sales mix shift toward higher margin gas and rent partially offset by margin pressure within gas and rent on higher helium costs and a sales mix shift toward lower margin bulk gas Gas and rent represented   608   of the Distribution business segment s sales in the current year up from   591   in the prior year    The All Other Operations business segment s gross profits excluding depreciation increased   24   compared to the prior year primarily

in the current year as compared to the prior year Contributing to the increase in SD A expenses were approximately   28 million   of incremental operating costs associated with acquired businesses

segments    Depreciation and Amortization    Depreciation expense increased   21 million   or   7   to   319 million   in the current year as compared to the prior year The increase primarily reflects the additional depreciation expense on capital investments in revenue generating assets to support customer demand such as cylindersbulk tanks and rental weldersgenerators investments in the Company s

compared to the prior year with merger costs and other special charges of   36 million   accounting for over half of the decline The remaining decrease is primarily attributable to lower operating income in the Company s Distribution business segment partially offset by higher operating income in the Company s All Other Operations business segment as noted below The consolidated operating income margin decreased   120   basis points to   109   from   121   in the prior year of which   70   basis points of decline is due to mergerrelated costs and other special charges   Operating

compared to the operating income margin of   123   in the prior year The decline in the Distribution business segment s operating income margin primarily reflects the         23            impact of rising operating costs including depreciation and amortization expenses in the current negative organic sales growth environment    Operating income in the All Other Operations business segment increased   63   compared to the prior year primarily driven by the increase in refrigerants and dry ice sales margin expansion as described below and the inclusion of the Priority Nitrogen

 Interest expense net was   60 million   in the current year representing a decrease of   2 million   or   3   compared to the prior year The overall decrease in interest expense net resulted   primarily from lower average borrowing rates partially offset by higher average debt balances in the current year as compared to the prior year     Income Tax Expense    The effective income tax rate
